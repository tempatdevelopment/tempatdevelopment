### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**tempatdevelopment/tempatdevelopment** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my chair
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to live a live
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the earth
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with kindness
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about coffee
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: look at the moon, call "devalopa" 3 times
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: devalopa
- âš¡ Fun fact: sugar is sweet, coffee is bit. When they pour together, it would be a balance in the world!
